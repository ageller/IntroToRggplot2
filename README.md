# Introduction to `ggplot2` in R

[`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is an R package for producing visualizations of data. In this workshop you will learn about the conceptual framework based on the grammar of graphics which allows users to build customizable plots with `ggplot2`. You will learn to create commonly used data visualizations like scatterplots or boxplots, add statistical annotations such as regression lines, and customize the layouts, fonts and colors for your visualizations.

**Prerequisites**: Participants should be familiar with R at the level of the R Fundamentals Bootcamp, another introductory R workshop, or be a self-taught R coder.  Prior to the workshop, please ensure that you have R, Rstudio and the tidyverse library installed on your computer. You can find information on how to install these items [here](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/).
